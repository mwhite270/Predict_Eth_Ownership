Below is a summary of its key components and functionalities:

*   **Purpose**: To predict whether an individual owns Ethereum based on various demographic and financial features.
*   **Dataset**: The dataset used for training and evaluation is owned by [The Omniacs DAO](https://github.com/Omni-Analytics-Group/).
*   **Model Architecture**: The predictive model is built using PyTorch.
*   **Output**: The model performs binary classification, meaning its output is either 'Yes' or 'No' regarding Ethereum ownership.
*   **Workflow**: The notebook includes sections for data loading and preprocessing, model setup (a simple Neural Network), training and validation, model testing, and an inference section (user entries) for making predictions on new data.
